### Discussion about the WAN (and humans) requirements for a Web 3.0

## WAN requirements
- Maximum respect for ***internet neutrality***.
- Symmetric connection bandwidth between two modem in a range of 100 km and priority to reduced TTL loss. 
- Connections in a range of 15 km should pass through a maximum of 2 ISPs routers. 
- For 5G connections, a connection passing through the same antenna should be direct. 

## Human requirements
- More a content is viewed, more is shared. If this content is innapropriate must not be viewed and shared. At the same time, contents could be voted for removal in relation to the number of sharers. Could be created more way for providing trust from people about removal through vote delegation, but one human has the same vote value of anyone else, and normally just a human or a important real organization alone couldn't impose removals decisions a priori. 
- Should exists a unique hash ID for every human, without references not even to the first name nor nationality. This should be used for voting purposes for avoiding votes from *things*. Organization has a representation value, but without it its vote value is zero.
